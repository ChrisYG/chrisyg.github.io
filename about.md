Hi there, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Yuxuan Gao (Chris), and I'm currently a senior majoring in Computer Science at Pomona College. I'm also the lead developer of [ASPC](https://aspc.pomona.edu), the website for the Associated Students of Pomona College. Check our project at [GitHub](https://github.com/aspc/mainsite).

I love learning new technologies, and enjoy building interesting projects in my free time. You can find me at [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/chris-yuxuan-gao) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisYG).
